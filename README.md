# PHPMobile
PHPMobile is a lightweight but ultra-powerful microframework that allows you to develop full Android applications using PHP and JavaScript, without needing a full native Android project setup. It leverages a WebView with an embedded PHP runtime, acting as a bridge between PHP/JS code and Android native features.
